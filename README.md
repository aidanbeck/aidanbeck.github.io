## Old Cove: 2025 Capstone Project
[Demo](https://aidanbeck.com/old-cove/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/aidanbeck/old-cove) |

*JavaScript, React, Java, Spring Boot*

A full-stack web application template designed to create interactive text adventures!

It features a scripting language designed for non-programmers to construct rooms, items, and dynamic state interactions. This was achieved by implementing my own NPM package [syntaxlor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/syntaxlor), a system for creating custom scripting syntax to suit a variety of use cases.

It also features user sign ups and log ins for saving progress in a playthrough, using Java and Spring Boot to implement CRUD functionality.

The front end is statically deployed and the back end is on GitHub.
